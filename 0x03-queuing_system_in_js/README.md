## Description :house:
In this project I began to apply redis in basic operations.<br>
External programs talk to Redis using a TCP socket and a Redis specific protocol. This protocol is implemented in the Redis client libraries for the different programming languages. However to make hacking with Redis simpler Redis provides a command line utility that can be used to send commands to Redis. This program is called redis-cli.

## Tasks :pencil:
**To update later. I'm behind time schedule!**
